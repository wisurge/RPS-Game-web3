# Security Implementation Summary

**For Client Review: ETH Protection Measures**

---

## üéØ CLIENT REQUIREMENT

> "Make it secure to prevent people from losing their ETH (think about what could go wrong, which kind of attack a party trying to always win could try, in particular make sure the salt is handled properly)."

---

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED SECURITY MEASURES

### 1. **Cryptographically Secure Salt Generation**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
// Use browser's CSPRNG, not Math.random()
const array = new Uint8Array(32); // 256 bits
window.crypto.getRandomValues(array); // Cryptographically secure
return hexString; // Keep as hex for precision
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ùå **Salt Prediction** - Impossible (2^256 possibilities)
- ‚ùå **Brute Force** - Computationally infeasible
- ‚ùå **Pattern Recognition** - Each salt is unique and random
- ‚ùå **Rainbow Tables** - Storage requirements impossible

---

### 2. **Proper Commitment Scheme**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
// Matches contract exactly: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(move, salt))
const saltBigInt = BigInt(salt);
const encoded = ethers.solidityPacked(["uint8", "uint256"], [move, saltBigInt]);
return ethers.keccak256(encoded);
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ùå **Front-Running** - Move is hidden in hash
- ‚ùå **Move Extraction** - One-way function
- ‚ùå **Hash Forgery** - Cryptographically impossible

---

### 3. **Multiple User Warnings**

**What We Did:**

**A. Critical Warning Banner After Game Creation:**

```
üö® CRITICAL: SAVE YOUR SALT NOW!

If you lose this salt, you will LOSE YOUR STAKED ETH!
- Copy the salt below to a password manager
- Write it down on paper as backup
- Do NOT rely only on this browser
- Clearing browser data will DELETE the salt

‚ö†Ô∏è There is NO WAY to recover a lost salt!
```

**B. Confirmation Dialog Before Reveal:**

```
üö® CRITICAL CHECK:

Move: Rock
Salt: 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...

Are these values EXACTLY what you used when creating the game?

‚ö†Ô∏è IF WRONG, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR STAKE!

Click OK only if you are 100% sure.
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User Error** - Reduces mistakes through clear warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Accidental Loss** - Multiple save opportunities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Misunderstanding** - Explicit consequences stated

---

### 4. **Balance Validation Before Transactions**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
const balance = await provider.getBalance(account);
const totalCost = stakeWei + gasPrice * estimatedGas;

if (balance < totalCost) {
  throw new Error(
    `Insufficient ETH. Need ${ethers.formatEther(totalCost)} ETH ` +
      `(${ethers.formatEther(stakeWei)} stake + gas), ` +
      `but you have ${ethers.formatEther(balance)} ETH`
  );
}
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ùå **Failed Transactions** - Check before submitting
- ‚ùå **Wasted Gas** - No transaction if insufficient funds
- ‚úÖ **Clear Feedback** - User knows exactly how much needed

---

### 5. **Network Validation**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
const validateNetwork = async () => {
  const network = await provider.getNetwork();
  if (Number(network.chainId) !== 11155111) {
    throw new Error("Wrong network! Please switch to Sepolia testnet.");
  }
};
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ùå **Wrong Network Transactions** - Blocked before submission
- ‚ùå **Lost Funds** - No mainnet accidents
- ‚úÖ **User Guidance** - Clear error message

---

### 6. **Transaction Receipt Validation**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
const receipt = await tx.wait();

if (receipt && receipt.status === 0) {
  throw new Error("Transaction reverted!");
}
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ùå **False Success Messages** - Detects reverted transactions
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Feedback** - User knows true transaction status
- ‚úÖ **Debug Information** - Includes transaction hash for investigation

---

### 7. **localStorage Backup**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
localStorage.setItem(
  `game_${contractAddress}`,
  JSON.stringify({
    contractAddress,
    move,
    salt,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  })
);
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚úÖ **Browser Refresh** - Salt recoverable if not cleared
- ‚úÖ **Accidental Close** - Data persists across sessions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Browser Data Clear** - User warned about this

**Note:** For mainnet, should encrypt this with user's wallet signature.

---

### 8. **Input Validation**

**What We Did:**

```typescript
// Validate all inputs before transactions
if (!move || move < 1 || move > 5) {
  throw new Error("Please select a valid move (1-5)");
}

if (!ethers.isAddress(opponentAddress)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid opponent address");
}

if (opponentAddress.toLowerCase() === account.toLowerCase()) {
  throw new Error("You cannot play against yourself");
}
```

**Protection Against:**

- ‚ùå **Invalid Moves** - Rejected before transaction
- ‚ùå **Invalid Addresses** - Format validation
- ‚ùå **Self-Play** - Prevented

---

## üõ°Ô∏è ATTACK VECTORS ANALYZED

### Attack Vector #1: Front-Running

**Can attacker see move before Player 2 plays?**

**Defense:** ‚úÖ **PREVENTED**

- Move is hashed with salt
- Hash cannot be reversed
- Even if attacker sees reveal transaction, Player 2 has already played

---

### Attack Vector #2: Salt Brute Force

**Can attacker guess the salt?**

**Defense:** ‚úÖ **PREVENTED**

- 256-bit salt = 2^256 possibilities
- Would take billions of years with all computers on Earth
- Cryptographically impossible

---

### Attack Vector #3: Always Win Strategy

**Can a malicious player guarantee winning?**

**Defense:** ‚úÖ **PREVENTED**

- Player 2 commits move before Player 1 reveals
- Player 1 cannot change move after commitment
- Player 2 cannot see Player 1's move before committing
- Fair game design prevents exploitation

**Possible Griefing:**

- Player 1 can refuse to reveal (loses stake after timeout)
- Player 2 can refuse to play (Player 1 gets refund after timeout)
- Both scenarios handled by timeout mechanism in contract

---

### Attack Vector #4: Timeout Exploitation

**Can player exploit timeout to steal funds?**

**Defense:** ‚úÖ **FAIR BY DESIGN**

- Player 2 didn't play ‚Üí Player 1 calls `j2Timeout()` ‚Üí Gets refund
- Player 1 didn't reveal ‚Üí Player 2 calls `j1Timeout()` ‚Üí Gets 2x stake
- Timeout is 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Fair for both parties

---

### Attack Vector #5: Replay Attack

**Can previous game data be reused?**

**Defense:** ‚úÖ **PREVENTED**

- Each game creates new contract
- New salt generated each time
- Contract address unique per game
- No replay possible

---

### Attack Vector #6: Man-in-the-Middle

**Can attacker intercept salt?**

**Defense:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**

- HTTPS protects network transmission
- MetaMask signs transactions locally
- localStorage vulnerable to XSS (testnet acceptable)

**For Production:** Encrypt salt with wallet signature

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING RISKS (User Responsibility)

### Risk #1: User Loses Salt

**Mitigation:**

- ‚úÖ Prominent warning banner
- ‚úÖ Multiple copy buttons
- ‚úÖ localStorage backup
- ‚úÖ Clear instructions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User must still save it**

---

### Risk #2: User Enters Wrong Move/Salt at Reveal

**Mitigation:**

- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog before reveal
- ‚úÖ Shows move and salt for verification
- ‚úÖ Warning about losing stake
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User must still verify**

---

### Risk #3: User Misses Timeout

**Mitigation:**

- ‚úÖ 5 minutes is reasonable time
- ‚úÖ localStorage allows recovery after refresh
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User must reveal within timeout**
