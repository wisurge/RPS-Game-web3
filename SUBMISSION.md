## 🎓 Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

### **Answer:**

**Each player should play each move with equal probability of 20% (1/5):**

- Rock: 20%
- Paper: 20%
- Scissors: 20%
- Spock: 20%
- Lizard: 20%

### **Explanation:**

RPSLS is a **symmetric zero-sum game** where:

- Each move beats exactly 2 other moves
- Each move loses to exactly 2 other moves
- All moves are equally strong

**Why 20% is optimal:**

When opponent plays uniformly (20% each), the expected payoff for any move is:

```
E[Payoff] = P(Win) × (+1) + P(Tie) × (0) + P(Lose) × (-1)
E[Payoff] = 0.4 × 1 + 0.2 × 0 + 0.4 × (-1) = 0
```

Since all moves have the same expected payoff (0), there's **no incentive to deviate** from the uniform strategy. This is the Nash Equilibrium.

**Key Insight:** No single move is "better" - the only winning strategy is complete randomization.

**📄 Full Mathematical Proof:** See `NASH_EQUILIBRIUM_EXPLANATION.md`

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### **Salt Handling (Client's Primary Concern):**

✅ **Cryptographically Secure Generation:**

- Uses `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` (CSPRNG, not Math.random())
- 256-bit entropy (2^256 possibilities - impossible to brute force)
- Each salt is unique and unpredictable

✅ **Proper Commitment Scheme:**

- Matches contract's `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(move, salt))` exactly
- One-way hash prevents move extraction
- Front-running attack prevented

✅ **User Protection:**

- 🚨 Critical warning banner after game creation
- ⚠️ Confirmation dialog before reveal
- 📋 localStorage backup
- 📝 Clear instructions to save salt

### **Attack Vectors Prevented:**

| Attack Type          | Defense                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Front-Running        | ✅ Commitment scheme hides move         |
| Brute Force Salt     | ✅ 256-bit = computationally impossible |
| Rainbow Tables       | ✅ Unique salts per game                |
| Always-Win Strategy  | ✅ Fair game design                     |
| Wrong Network        | ✅ Sepolia enforced                     |
| Insufficient Balance | ✅ Pre-transaction validation           |

### **Transaction Safety:**

- ✅ Balance validated before each transaction
- ✅ Network validated (Sepolia only)
- ✅ Receipt status checked (detects reverts)
- ✅ Etherscan links in all errors
- ✅ Input validation on all fields

**📄 Detailed Analysis:** See `SECURITY_SUMMARY.md`

## ✨ Features Implemented

### **Core Requirements:**

- ✅ Web3 interface for RPSLS game
- ✅ Player 1 creates game with hidden commitment + stake
- ✅ Player 2 joins with matching stake + plays move
- ✅ Player 1 reveals move → contract distributes ETH
- ✅ 5-minute timeout protection for both players
- ✅ Works with MetaMask on Sepolia testnet

### **Security Enhancements:**

- ✅ Cryptographically secure salt (proper handling as requested)
- ✅ Multiple user warnings to prevent ETH loss
- ✅ Balance validation prevents wasted gas
- ✅ Network validation prevents wrong-chain errors
- ✅ Transaction receipt validation
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs on critical actions

### **UX Improvements:**

- ✅ Modern, professional design (refactored to look natural)
- ✅ Automatic network switching
- ✅ Clear error messages with Etherscan links
- ✅ Game state checker
- ✅ Responsive mobile design

## 💬 Design Decisions (Commented in Code)

All critical decisions are documented in the source code with detailed comments:

**1. Salt Security (`hooks/useGame.ts:248-287`):**

```typescript
/**
 * SECURITY CRITICAL: Most important security function
 * - Uses CSPRNG not Math.random()
 * - 256-bit entropy
 * - Returns hex string to avoid precision loss
 */
```

**2. Commitment Scheme (`hooks/useGame.ts:289-319`):**

```typescript
/**
 * Must match contract's hash function exactly
 * - Uses solidityPacked to match abi.encodePacked
 * - Proper BigInt conversion
 */
```

**3. Network Validation (`hooks/useGame.ts:321-339`):**

```typescript
/**
 * Enforce Sepolia testnet only
 * - Prevents mainnet accidents
 * - Called before every transaction
 */
```

**4. TOCTOU Fix (`hooks/useGame.ts:449-461`):**

```typescript
/**
 * Return state without throwing errors
 * - Fixes race condition
 * - Contract is source of truth
 */
```
