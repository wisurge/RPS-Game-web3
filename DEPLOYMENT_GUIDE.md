---

### **‚úÖ 2. GitHub link included**

**Repository URL:**

```
[Paste your GitHub repository link here]
Example: https://github.com/username/rpsls-dapp
```

**Repository Contents:**

- ‚úÖ Complete source code
- ‚úÖ Smart contract (RPS.sol)
- ‚úÖ All documentation files
- ‚úÖ README with setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Security analysis documents
- ‚úÖ Nash equilibrium explanation

---

### **‚úÖ 3. Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium Explanation**

**Document:** `NASH_EQUILIBRIUM_EXPLANATION.md`

**Answer Summary:**

- Each player should play each move with equal probability (20% each)
- Rock: 20%, Paper: 20%, Scissors: 20%, Spock: 20%, Lizard: 20%
- This ensures expected payoff of 0 for both players
- No move provides an advantage
- No incentive to deviate

**Mathematical proof and detailed explanation included in the document.**

---

### **‚úÖ 4. Comments for design/logic decisions**

**Key Commented Sections:**

**A. Salt Generation (`hooks/useGame.ts`):**

```typescript
/**
 * SECURITY CRITICAL: Most important security function
 * - Uses CSPRNG not Math.random()
 * - 256-bit entropy
 * - Returns hex string to avoid precision loss
 * - Attack resistance documented
 */
```

**B. Commitment Scheme (`hooks/useGame.ts`):**

```typescript
/**
 * Must match contract's hash function exactly
 * - Uses solidityPacked to match abi.encodePacked
 * - Proper BigInt conversion
 * - Critical for reveal to work
 */
```

**C. Network Validation:**

```typescript
/**
 * Enforce Sepolia testnet only
 * - Prevents mainnet accidents
 * - Called before every transaction
 */
```

**D. Balance Validation:**

```typescript
/**
 * Check balance before transaction
 * - Prevents wasted gas
 * - Shows detailed cost breakdown
 * - User-friendly error messages
 */
```

**E. TOCTOU Fix:**

```typescript
/**
 * Return state without throwing errors
 * - Fixes race condition
 * - Contract is source of truth
 */
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Deployment

### **Vercel Build Errors:**

If you get TypeScript errors during Vercel build:

**Option 1: Skip TypeScript check (for demo):**

```json
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Fix TypeScript errors:**

```bash
npm run build
# Fix any errors shown
```

### **Environment Variables:**

For Vercel, no environment variables are needed for this project (all client-side).

---

## üìä Testing the Deployed Version

### **After Deployment:**

1. **Visit the URL** in your browser
2. **Connect MetaMask** (make sure you're on Sepolia)
3. **Create a game:**
   - Use 2 different MetaMask accounts
   - Start with small stake (0.001 ETH)
   - Save the salt!
4. **Complete the game flow**
5. **Verify winner gets ETH**

### **What to Test:**

- ‚úÖ Network switching works
- ‚úÖ Balance validation works
- ‚úÖ Game creation deploys contract
- ‚úÖ Salt is displayed and copyable
- ‚úÖ Game joining matches stake
- ‚úÖ Reveal validates move/salt
- ‚úÖ Timeout functions work after 5 minutes
